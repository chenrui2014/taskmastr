## taskmastr
Yet another todo list web app built with the MEAN stack.

_features:_
- Uses a single key instead of a user/password login to store and retrieve information from the database.
- Does not require use of a key to use, but there is no session storage so you lose your todos.
- Delete, reorder, and rename todos.
- Dark mode for those of us who are tired of looking at white screens all the time.
- White mode for those of us who are afraid of the dark.

_todo:_
- Revisit for bugs/quirkiness.
