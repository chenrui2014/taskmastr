## taskmastr
Yet another todo list web app built with the MEAN stack (not mean.io or mean.js, though...). You can find a hosted version of this at [taskmastr.co](http://www.taskmastr.co)

## New in v3.0.0
Authentication has been rewritten to use a standard username/password authentication via Passport and bcrypt hashing.

Session storage for up to 30 days. This also means you can now log out whenever you want.

## New in v2.3.0
Night Mode/Bright Mode (formerly Dark Mode/Light Mode) has been revamped on the client side of things, being both more intuitive and beautiful now. 

## New in v2.2.0
Undo! There's now a five-second delay when deleting a todo, which can be cancelled.
