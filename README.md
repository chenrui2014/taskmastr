## taskmastr
Yet another todo list web app built with the MEAN stack (not mean.io or mean.js, though...). You can find a hosted version of this at [taskmastr.co](http://www.taskmastr.co)

## New in v2.3.0
Night Mode/Bright Mode (formerly Dark Mode/Light Mode) has been revamped on the client side of things, being both more intuitive and beautiful now. 

## New in v2.2.0
Undo! There's now a five-second delay when deleting a todo, which can be cancelled.

_features:_
- Uses a single key instead of a user/password login to store and retrieve information from the database.
- Delete, reorder, and rename todos.
- 5-second undo when deleting a todo.
- Night mode for those of us who work when we should be sleeping.
- Bright mode for those of us who are afraid of the dark.
- Now with COOL animations! More fun guaranteed!
- Mobile-friendly.

_todo:_
- Sub-tasks
