## taskmastr
Yet another todo list web app built with Node.js and MongoDB. This is a testing ground for the MEAN stack, just without any A a the moment (coming soon).

_features:_
- Uses a single key instead of a user/password login to store and retrieve information from the database.
- Does not require use of a key to use, but there is no session storage so you lose your todos.
- Delete, reorder, and rename todos.

_todo:_
Angularize.
