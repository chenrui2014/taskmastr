## taskmastr
Yet another todo list web app built with the MEAN stack (not mean.io or mean.js, though...). You can find a hosted version of this at [taskmastr.co](http://www.taskmastr.co)

##New in v5.0.0
Notifications! Use the new datepicker next to each task to assign a due date, and we'll send you a handy reminder at 6am the day of.

##New in v4.1.0
We now have a pathway for resetting user passwords. Put in your email, check "Forgot your password?" and submit the form to receive a link that will allow you to create a new password.

Also changed up the animations for more bounciness.

##New in v4.0.0
Lists! You can now maintain multiple lists in taskmastr, with all the fixins included: Deleting, reordering, renaming.

We also store the list that's currently being viewed so if you switch lists and save, when you come back you'll be looking at the same list.

We also added more keyboard shortcuts to control the Lists menu, and also to control Night Mode.

Last and probably least, we said "No." to the mobile button next to each task that was designed to better use space on small devices. The experience just wasn't quite there, and the space saved didn't justify the extra clicks.

## New in v3.0.0
Authentication has been rewritten to use a standard username/password authentication via Passport and bcrypt hashing.

Session storage for up to 30 days. This also means you can now log out whenever you want.
